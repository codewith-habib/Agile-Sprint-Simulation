# Agile Development and Scrum Simulation

üéâ **Certification Project for Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum** üéâ  
Completed as part of the IBM course with honor.

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project simulates a 2-week Agile Sprint to demonstrate the key principles and practices of Agile Development and Scrum. It includes creating and managing a Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, conducting Sprint Planning, and moving stories through various stages of the Kanban board.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Requirements
To complete this project successfully, the following requirements and tasks were necessary:

### **Stakeholder Requirements**
1. **Create a product in the catalog**.  
2. **Retrieve a product from the catalog**.  
3. **Update a product in the catalog**.  
4. **Delete a product from the catalog**.  
5. **Like a product in the catalog**.  
6. **Dislike a product in the catalog**.  
7. **List all products in the catalog**.  
8. **Query a subset of products in the catalog**.  
9. **Host the application in the cloud**.  
10. **Automate deployments to the cloud**.  

---

### **Instructional Tasks**
1. **Create a new GitHub repository**:  
   - Repository name: `agile-final-project` (must be public).  

2. **Set up a GitHub Project Board**:  
   - Name the board: `Final Project`.  

3. **Create an Issue Template**:  
   - Include the structure:  
     ```
     As a [user/persona], I need [what you need] so that [value/benefit].
     ```

4. **Create Issues**:  
   - Create 10 issues based on the stakeholder requirements above.  

5. **Organize the Kanban Board**:  
   - Move issues 7 and 8 to the **Icebox**.  
   - Move the remaining issues to the **Product Backlog**.

6. **Backlog Refinement**:  
   - Rank the Product Backlog to match the stakeholder requirements order.  

7. **Define Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Update the top 5 stories in the Product Backlog with acceptance criteria using Gherkin syntax:  
     ```
     Given [initial context],  
     When [event occurs],  
     Then [outcome].
     ```

8. **Label Issues**:  
   - Add a **technical debt** label.  
   - Label stories in the Product Backlog as **enhancement** or **technical debt**.

9. **Create a Sprint Milestone**:  
   - Name the milestone: `Sprint`.  
   - Set the duration: 2 weeks.  

10. **Conduct Sprint Planning**:  
    - Add the top 4 stories to the sprint.  
    - Assign them to the **Sprint Milestone** and estimate story points.  
    - Move these 4 stories to the **Sprint Backlog**.

11. **Simulate the Sprint**:  
    - Assign the top story to yourself and move it through the Kanban board stages:
      - **In Progress** ‚Üí **Review/QA** ‚Üí **Done**.
    - Repeat the process for subsequent stories until the sprint ends.  

12. **Review Burndown Chart**:  
    - Ensure the Burndown Chart reflects the progress accurately.

13. **Share for Peer Review**:  
    - Share the Kanban board URL for peer feedback.

## üèÜ Key Features
1. **Product Backlog Management**:  
   Enhanced all stories in the Product Backlog by addressing technical debt and adding necessary enhancements.
   
2. **Sprint Planning**:  
   - Created a sprint milestone named `Sprint` with a duration of 2 weeks.  
   - Conducted a Sprint Planning meeting.  
   - Moved the top 4 stories to the Sprint Backlog and assigned story point estimates.

3. **Sprint Execution**:  
   Simulated an Agile Sprint with the following steps:  
   - Moved stories through **In Progress**, **Review/QA**, and **Done** columns.
   - Ensured proper assignment of stories to team members (simulated).  
   - Monitored progress with an accurate Burndown Chart.

4. **Kanban Board**:  
   - Visualized the flow of work from the Product Backlog to completion.
   - Shared the Kanban board for peer review.

## üìú Steps Followed
1. Enhanced or added technical debt to all stories in the Product Backlog.
2. Created a Sprint milestone with a duration of 2 weeks.
3. Conducted a Sprint Planning meeting:
   - Added the top 4 stories to the Sprint Backlog.
   - Assigned story point estimates.
4. Simulated a Sprint:
   - Moved stories through the Kanban board stages:
     - **In Progress**
     - **Review/QA**
     - **Done**
   - Ensured tasks were completed in the correct sequence during the sprint.
5. Ensured the **Burndown Chart** displayed correctly to reflect sprint progress.
6. Shared the Kanban board URL for peer review.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Kanban Board**: Used to manage and visualize the progress of the sprint.
- **Burndown Chart**: Monitored progress during the sprint.

## üåü Burndown Chart
The Burndown Chart displayed the accurate tracking of work completed during the sprint. This ensured that the sprint progress aligned with Agile principles.

## üìÇ Project Structure
The project primarily focused on simulation and documentation, so no code is included. The key deliverables are:
- Kanban board URL.
- Documentation of the simulation process.
